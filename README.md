# Button Console

This is a small project to try out making sounds with JavaScript's Web Audio API. A few buttons here, some noises there.

## Current Goals
1. Make 1 - 3 pads of up to 9 buttons each
2. Pads activate different sound banks (Ex: saw, sine, square)
3. Pads will be mobile friendly
4. Sound must work on mobile.

## Stretch Goals
1. Recordable songs?
